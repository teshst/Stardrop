# Flatpak

This fork of Stardrop is for my own community flatpak package built from a 1:1 copy of Stardrop repo without any custom changes to the code base.

This project only exist to provide a reliable flatpak that is 1:1 of the official repo until the developers support an official flatpak version.

# Stardrop
 
Stardrop is an open-source, cross-platform mod manager for the game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/). It is built using the Avalonia UI framework.

Stardrop utilizes [SMAPI (Stardew Modding API)](https://smapi.io/) to simplify the management and update checking for all applicable Stardew Valley mods.

Profiles are also supported, allowing users to have multiple mod groups for specific gameplay or multiplayer sessions.
